## Recommended Actions

1. Review the list of outdated dependencies
2. Test the CLI with updated dependencies

   - Fix security vulnerabilities
   - Resolve bugs affecting our CLI
   - Provide significant performance improvements

For major version updates, consider creating separate PRs to isolate potential breaking changes.
